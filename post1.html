    <p><strong>Manga Play Directed By LEON JR</strong></p>

    <p>
      This story is about a boy named Tsukasa who always failed in what he was doing
      in his world no matter how small it was. On a faithful day, Tsukasa was caught
      in a road accident where he lost his life—or so he thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was spoken to by a Goddess who reincarnated him as the strongest sage and
      knight from the weakest household in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was reborn as Loid, son of Baron Eren and Mistress Kimiko, with a senior
      sister named Ino.
    </p>

    <p>
      Loid secretly trained magic and swordsmanship, determined to prove he was not
      a failure.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the academy, Loid awakened a rare aptitude combining black, gold, and green
      magic—something unseen since the last hero.
