  <p><strong>Manga Play Directed By LEON JR</strong></p>

  <p>
    This story is about a boy named Tsukasa who always failed in what he was doing
    in his world no matter how small it was. On a faithful day, Tsukasa was caught
    in a road accident where he lost his life—or so he thought.
  </p>

  <p>
    He was spoken to by a Goddess who gave him requirements and reincarnated him as
    the strongest sage and knight from the weakest household in the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    There he was reborn to Baron Eren and Mistress Kimiko and was given the name
    Loid. He also had a senior sister named Ino.
  </p>

  <p>
    Loid spent his childhood studying magic without the knowledge of his parents,
    and privately trained swordsmanship by himself so he could prove he was not a
    failure in this world.
  </p>

  <p>
    One day, his father caught him training and renounced him, saying there was no
    need to train since their household was the weakest and seen as trash. But Loid
    replied:
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>
      “Father, I will make it known to everyone in this village that we can also be
      the strongest. I will be the strongest mage ever. I promise you.”
    </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Those words shocked his father, who decided to hire a great magical mentor for
    Loid, while Loid also trained swordsmanship with the Baron’s Knight.
  </p>

  <p>
    After six years of training, Loid reached the age of 16 and went to the School
    for Future Mages and Knights.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the magical aptitude test, Loid touched the crystal orb and emitted a
    mixture of black, gold, and green light—something unseen since the last hero
    who was killed by Demon Lord Igris.
  </p>

  <p>
    Teaching began the following day.
